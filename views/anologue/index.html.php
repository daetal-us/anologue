	<p>i need to have a conversation with a couple people.</p>
	<p>there's <strong>email</strong>, but i get pretty sick of the copied text that quickly gets out of control, the unnecessary repetition of everyone's signuatures... overlapping responses. and, i get so much crap in my inbox as-is--it can be cumbersome to try and isolate relevant emails and then the important parts of them.</p>
	<p>i don't like <strong>instant messaging</strong>. there are so many clients out there, and, sure there are tools to help them come together, but there are some people that will never use <em>im</em> (i don't blame them, i just haven't had the choice.)</p>
	<p><strong>twitter</strong> is right out.</p>
	<p>then, there's one of my favorites: <strong>irc</strong>. but, let's face it: it's mostly for nerds.</p>
	<p><strong>google wave</strong> may be an option... someday. even so, in my experience with the beta so far i'd have to argue that multi-threaded chats are actually less productive.</p> 
	<p>so, i needed something different.</p>

		<span>your future us's use anologue!</span>
		</aside>
	</div>

	<p><strong>anologue</strong> is like comments, meets im, meets irc, meets <a href="http://pastium.org">your favorite paste app</a>, meets instant coffee.</p>
	<p>actually, instant coffee sucks.</p>
	<p>with anologue you can quickly and easily engage in an anonymous (or not) linear dialogue with any number of people (within reason).</p>
	<p><strong>no accounts. no installations. no way?! <em>yes, way!</em></strong></p>
	<p><a href="/new">your "chat room" is created by the time this link loads</a>. invite whoever you want by giving them your unique link, and chat away.</p>

	<h2 class="sub">let's make this better, together</h2>
