<p>it's dead simple. i need to have a conversation with one or more people.</p>
<p>there's <strong>email</strong>, but i get pretty sick of the delays, the copied text that quickly gets out of control. i get sick of signuatures. and i get so much crap in my inbox as-is, it can be cumbersome to try and isolate those emails and then isolate the important parts of them.</p>
<p>i don't like <strong>instant messaging</strong>. there are so many clients out there, and, sure there are tools to help them come together, but there are some people that will never us im (and i don't blame them.) so that doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>twitter</strong> is right out.</p>
<p>then, there's one of my favorites: <strong>irc</strong>. but, let's face it, it's mostly for nerds.</p>
<h2 class="sub">anonymous (or not) dialogue</h2>
<p>it's like im, meets irc, meets <a href="http://pastium.org">your favorite paste app</a>, meets instant coffee.</p>
<p>no accounts. no installations. no shit? <a href="/new">just dive in to a chat</a>, invite whoever you want by giving them a link, and chat away. if you can type, you can use anologue. and, judging by the average commenter on youtube, i'd say that includes all but those without electricity. for the more technically saavy, you may appreciate the implementation of markdown and use of gravatar.</p>

<p>this is open source. let's make this better, together. built with php 5.3, using the lithium framework, couchdb, jquery and perhaps a few other scripts that all come together for the gooey goodness that you're about to experience. this one's for you: internets.</p>
